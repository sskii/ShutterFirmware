# ShutterFirmware
Firmware for an electronic shutter timer with a graphical user interface. Designed for the Atmel ATmega328p microcontroller on an Arduino board.

Written in C++ in VSCode with PlatformIO. I'd highly recommend this combination for more complicated Arduino development.

## Connectivity
Designed to connect to a mechanical shutter with release and catch coils. GUI is displayed on a Nokia 8110 LCD.
