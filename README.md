# ShutterFirmware
Firmware for an electronic shutter timer with a graphical user interface. Designed for the Atmel ATmega328p microcontroller on an Arduino board.

Written in C++ in VSCode with PlatformIO. I'd highly recommend this combination for more complicated Arduino development.

## Connectivity
Designed to connect to a mechanical shutter with release and catch coils. GUI is displayed on a Nokia 8110 LCD.

## Directory Structure
This project uses the default structure created by PlatformIO. Briefly and most importantly;

`src` contains all of the .cpp code files.
`include` contains all of the .h header files.
`lib` could contain any required libraries (although there should be a way to import directly from GitHub that would be preferred).

Each directory is better described by the default `README` file contained within.
